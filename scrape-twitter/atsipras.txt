At the #Libya Summit in Palermo. We have to support #UN initiatives for peace & stability through promoting a political process without exclusions for the constitution & democratic elections. The support of #EU to the Egyptian-led process on the armed forces & security is crucial
A Europe that deepens the gap between the rich & the poor, which raises walls & fences, in which technocrats are considered superior to the elected representatives of the people, and indifferent to the future of its new generation, is a failed Europe. #parispeaceforum
Both the far right and the nationalists have their own strategy that is clear and timeless. The division of society, the targeting of particular social groups, the cultivation of fear, the invocation of a national grandeur, where only the chosen ones can fit. #parispeaceforum
Europe was rebuilt after two world wars, based on social justice, labor protection, gender equality, upgrading of infrastructure and networks, peace and cooperation among the peoples. #parispeaceforum
History never gives us time, nor forgives us for the mistakes we make at critical times. For this reason, developing a progressive left-wing strategy today, in view of the European elections, is urgent. #SPDdc #SPD
Both Social Democrats and the Left have to stand together. On the basis of a progressive plan for the 21st century in Europe. Such a strategy can stop the upsurge of the far right, nationalism and xenophobia.
A clear goal for the Left is the redistribution of wealth and the support of the weak. We need to prioritize the debate on wages. It is an extremely important aspect of the overall strategy of the Left. #SPD
Today we need to ask ourselves, in full awareness of the consequences of our political choices: For whom do we make these choices? Who do we choose to represent? Which lives are improving by our policies? #SPD

Congratulations my friend @Zoran_Zaev ! Tonight’s vote is a big step towards our common success. A very important step to a peaceful and prosperous future for our people!
Greece has an important role to play in this context as it exits the crisis and becomes a European pillar of peace and stability in the region, as well as a regional hub for trade, transport and energy. #ASEM12
At a time of growing economic interdependence, an increase in global challenges, we must confront fragmentation and nationalism. Europe’s dialogue and cooperation with Asia is crucial. #ASEM12

With our expatriates in New York. Thanks to the efforts of the Greek people, we managed to exit the regime of harsh surveillance. Today, we are all determined to turn a page.
An important element, in this concept, is that political stability prevails now in the country, as well as a number of initiatives, such as the Prespa Agreement, and they open the door to economic cooperation in the Balkans.
After 8 hard years our priority is to create the climate for productive investments that will create jobs. At meetings I had with investors& business executives of Bank of America Merrill Lynch & Morgan Stanley, I explained that now we must support the recovery of Greek economy
Very happy to meet Evo yesterday in New York. Social movements in Latin America are a special chapter in the history of the Left. Today we can and must  take the initiative to create a new forum of dialogue between the left and progressive forces all over the world.

We were the first to argue that Europe should begin to discuss on a new framework, where rights and obligations are clear but also are realistic and fair. Back then there weren’t many who shared that view. But now, this discussion is on the top of the European agenda.#Concordia18
Apart from those demagogues, we cannot ignore the voices of the elitesa stubborn status quo who denies responsibility for the wrongdoings of the past decade, who argues that the only ones that are to be blamed are the people and their choices.#Concordia18 #Concordiasummit
They are building a colossal mechanism of fake news and propaganda in order to create a distorted image of reality. To deceive people and make them feel insecure and afraid.#Concordia18 #Concordiasummit
In Greece, Europe, and across the globe, the end of the era of economic crisis that’s lasted over a decade now, is good news. But that doesn’t mean that we now have a stable ground to build a safe and prosperous future.

We must not let the EU crumble between neoliberalism & the far-right. We don't need less solidarity and more borders but a new social ontract for the cohesion and prosperity of our peoples. All progressive, democratic and pro-European forces have a duty to unite towards that end
The EU's failure to provide democratic & functional responses to modern challenges, will result in the triumph of chauvinism and the revival of nationalist antagonisms. It will transform Europe into a fragmented continent, without unity, consistency, and prospect. #FutureofEurope

A mandate to put an end to systemic corruption. Starting tomorrow, we begin our work to tackle these problems.  #Greece #GreekElections
A clear mandate for a four year term. #Syriza will stand tall, it won't be intimidated. This victory belongs to the working classes. #Greece
Today, both #Greece and the Greek people are synonymous with pride and perseverance. #GreekElections
A clear mandate to cast aside those forces that have been holding us back. #GreekElections #Greece

The will of our people will not be a parenthesis #kerdizoume_to_aurio #syriza #Greece
Thank you for this incredible rally. We have justice on our side, we will be victorious. #kerdizoume_to_aurio #syriza
For a great victory for #Syriza. For the Left in #Greece. For hope to remain alive in Europe. #kerdizoume_to_aurio
This Sunday, let no vote go to waste. #syriza #kerdizoume_to_aurio #Greece
There is no turning back. Greece will go forward, led by its ppl & w/#Syriza as its compass. #kerdizoume_to_aurio
To continue our efforts against the extreme-right, neoliberal forces who want to take their revenge for the courage shown by the Greek ppl.
The Greek people want us to continue the fight that we started on January 25th. #syriza #kerdizoume_to_aurio #Greece
We have no choice but to fight to save Europe from ideologies that champion hate and destruction. #syriza
This kind of Europe is so far removed from Europe's founding values. This kind of Europe has no future.
Or a Europe like the wealthy state of Bavaria, that despite its prosperity refuses to accommodate 30,000 #refugees?
A Europe with the ethos of Lesbos & Kos, poor islands that despite the crisis have hosted tens of thousands of #refugees. #Greece
Or a Europe of the Hungarian PM, who relies on bullets and building fences?
A Europe exemplified by the baker in Kos, handing out bread to refugee children from the little he has?
What kind of Europe do we want? #kerdizoume_to_aurio #syriza
To have @Pablo_Iglesias_ from Spain by his side, @GerryAdamsSF from Ireland and a progressive PM from Portugal. #kerdizoume_to_aurio #syriza
Imagine what a difference it would make if the Greek PM did not stand alone--one against many--in Brussels. #kerdizoume_to_aurio #syriza
Europe is split between progressive forces & conservative forces, such as the EPP-Merkel's party, the party that New Democracy belongs to.
Europe has become divided into two camps: those who support Schäuble's plan, and those who support #Syriza's plan. #kerdizoume_to_aurio
On Sunday, we're facing a crucial referendum-to put an end to old political system, protecting oligarchs & corruption #kerdizoume_to_aurio
Citizens of Athens, today's rally sends a message of determination and victory. #syriza #kerdizoume_to_aurio #Greece
History is made by the people. #kerdizoume_to_aurio #syriza

Dilemma we'll be facing nxt Sunday is simple: do we want a #Greece that'll favor the 1% or 99%? The choice is in your hands #ERTdebate2015
We need to invest in research & innovation, & upgrade public universities to stem flow of young people leaving country #ERTdebate2015
Change doesn't magically happen-it requires a fight. I'm calling on Greek ppl: it'll take a fight maintain hope, our efforts #ERTdebate2015
#Greece needs a progressive government--not two parties with polar opposite views. #ERTdebate2015
Initially you stated I should be PM, now you're demoting me to VP. Isn't that the role you've carved out for Venizelos? #ERTdebate2015
New Democracy isn't inviting us to work together for sake of national unity, but to engage in masking nation's problems #ERTdebate2015
There won't be further elections because a progressive government will result. #ERTdebate2015
#Syriza is a party that upholds #democracy. The party split because certain members wished to break off #ERTdebate2015
Investments require reduced bureaucracy, strong laws, new development options-even if we have a higher tax rate than Bulgaria #ERTdebate2015
Despite agreement's challenges, w/ implementation & debt restructuring we can return to growth that respects social contract #ERTdebate2015
The proponents of #Grexit hoped #Syriza would be a 'Left parenthesis', incl certain heads of state, w/ extreme views #ERTdebate2015
Ch. Merkel & I acted w/mutual respect re: our institutional roles. Advocating views w/integrity & conviction begets respect #ERTdebate2015
Our reelection would send a message to those championing austerity, that we seek to #endausterity #ERTdebate2015
The GR elections are critical for all Europe. V negative msg to all ppl if forces that champion 'no other alternative' return #ERTdebate2015
We're in favor of increasing maritime surveillance, however the #refugeecrisis must be dealt with in a humane manner #ERTdebate2015
The Coast Guard has a duty to save #refugees. The situation doesn't call for the use of military operations. #ERTdebate2015
Mr. Meimarakis has openly stated that ND's plan is to fully repay a debt which cannot be repaid. The debt is not sustainable #ERTdebate2015
We fought to uphold the rights of the Greek people. #ERTdebate2015
Europe is engaged in a political battle. On the right, the hegemony of Merkel and Schäuble dominate. #ERTdebate2015
Our choice was a matter of national responsibility to avoid Schäuble's Grexit plans #ERTdebate2015
The Greek people want a Prime Minister who will be honest #ERTdebate2015
We fought hard to maintain current standards for pensions, & option to find equivalent measures still remains on the table. #ERTdebate2015
The company is using extortionary tactics, and its employees are taking the brunt of the fallout. #ERTdebate2015 #skouries
#ERTdebate2015 How will we be able to negotiate the debt when he believes that the debt is sustainable?
#ERTdebate2015 The issue with Mr. Meimarakis is that we have fundamental differences.
